<FONT FACE ="ARIAL BLACK",FONT COLOR="BLACK" FONT SIZE="3"><P>My parents had always told me that it is extremely important to
<br>receive a diploma and a bachelor's degree not only because of acquisition of new knowledge but
<br>also because of the different experiences that people receive in four years at the university.
<br>My experience so far at UiTM has been a roller coaster ride.
<br>It has had its ups and downs similar to any other new experience to a person.
<br>As a freshman it takes some adjusting to get used to the style, 
<br>especially when I have had the support from my parents for a long time.
<br>I have had moments here that I have enjoyed, and other ones that I would rather not have to deal with.</P>
<br>

<FONT FACE ="ARIAL BLACK",FONT COLOR="black"><P>It has been a few months since I last finished my diploma and pursuing my bachelor's degree, 
<br>but it definitely has been an experience I will need in the future and it is better to learn it now than later on down the road.
<br>One of the biggest thing that was a big change was going away, and not living at home. 
<br>I have never been on an extended stay away from home, and I’m enjoying it to an extent. 
<br>However, due to the pandemic season all the university were closed and students were asked to have an online classes instead.
<br>My online learning experience as a student is not so good.
<br>I have to wake up early every day and I'm not a morning person.
<br>In addition, online classes is confusing when the lecturer gives us work mostly since it's easier for me to do work 
<br>with instructions that the lecturer gives.
<br>Being in a physical classroom makes me only focus on my work, but online learning makes it harder to focus 
<br>because I have to also focus on household stuff, and it throws me off.
<br>I would not want to do online learning in the future because it is hard for me to concentrate on my work only.</p>
<br>

<FONT FACE ="ARIAL BLACK",FONT COLOR="black"><P>Nevertheless, UiTM is a place that truly helps shaping one's personality.
<BR> UiTM is like another Godsend gift for me. It is one of the best universities in my entire vicinity. 
<BR> We are truly cared, rightly educated and well socialized here. I myself feel proud of being a student here. 
<BR>I do take care of what is being taught and what is to learn. 
<BR> I respect my lecturers, my fellow beings, my university and everything that is associated with it. </P>
<BR>

<FONT FACE ="ARIAL BLACK",FONT COLOR="black"><P> My university experiences thus far have been amazing, despite the hard things and a very hectic life. 
<BR> I have learned and experienced so many new things in such a short period of time, and it has gone by so fast. 
<BR>I am still discovering all the opportunities that university offers me. 
<BR> UiTM is a very welcoming place, and from the first day, I felt at home here. 
<BR>I have made many new friends from many different backgrounds. 
<BR> There are from Kedah, Perlis and many more and that has allowed me an insight into their cultures. </P>

<FONT FACE ="ARIAL BLACK",FONT COLOR="black"><P>I am a good student, I study well. 
<BR> The proudest action I have encountered, 
<br>would be making the Dean’s List as I ended my last semester at UiTM Kedah with a 3.7 GPA. 
<BR>I do not think my parents have been more 
<br>proud of me than in the moment they found out how well I had done.
<BR> But I think I could do better in future and appreciate every positive sentiment.
<BR> Also, I am grateful of the genuine love and support that I have received from my family and close friends.</P></CENTER>
