	  <H1>Nur Aina Yasmin Binti Noor Azizy</H1>
<P>I am the eldest of two siblings. I was born on 26th May 1999 in Pulau Pinang.
<br>I stayed with my family in Bukit Mertajam. 
<br>I am the first year degree student in UiTM Machang, Kelantan, majoring in Bachelor of Office Systems Management.</p></CENTER>
<br>

	<CENTER>
I can confidently say that I am:
<OL>
 <li> A Good Student </li>
 <li> I like to study </li>
</OL>

<P>My university experiences especially during this pandemic season thus far have been amazing, despite the hard things and a very hectic life. 
<BR> I have learned and experienced so many new things in such a short period of time, and it has gone by so fast. 
<BR>I am still discovering all the opportunities that university offers me. 
<BR>I have also made many new friends from many different backgrounds.
<BR>I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. 
<BR>Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER>
I enjoy my time during classes because:
<OL>
 <li> It is really nice to study </li>
 <li> The students are very friendly and ready to help </li>
</OL>
</CENTER>
<br>

<CENTER>
	<p style="font-family: cursive;">
		<font-allign: justified;></font-allign:>
<P>I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. 
<BR>I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.</P></CENTER>
<BR>

	<p style="font-family: cursive;">

<P>My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. 
<BR>As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. 
<BR>I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. 
<BR>We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. 
<BR>I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.
<BR>Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. 
<BR>Many of those friends who surround me now I met online while doing my hobby. 
<BR>I love writing, so the thing I want to learn more about is literature as I'd always loved writing and reading.
<BR>I’m passionate about reading.
<BR>Reading gives me a level of fulfillment. It
rejuvenates me. 
<BR>After reading a book, I feel like a
whole new being and my outlook in life changes.
<BR>Most of my ‘me-time’ is actually spent on reading.</P></CENTER>

<p style="font-family: cursive;">

<P>I know everyone should have a goal in their life that they are striving to get to. 
<BR>Me personally, have many goals that I would like to reach throughout my life. 
<BR>The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself.
<BR>Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, 
<BR>with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. 
<BR>I want to reach all of my desired goals and it would be a great success in my life. 
<BR>One thing I learned is,<I>“You have to work hard for the things you want in life, and twice as hard to keep
it.”</I> 
<BR>Only when we dream big, we can become the one we dream in future. Many people wonder if I can achieve and fulfill
my dream. 
<BR> My confidence and hard work will take me to my dream soon.
<BR>I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. 
<BR>With all I already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well.</P></CENTER>
